/**

 *
 * ─── Idempotency, and why it is not optional ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `dedupeKey` identifies the EVENT, not the attempt: `booking_completed:bk_123`.
 * The same booking completing twice is not a thing that can happen; the same
 * WEBHOOK arriving twice absolutely is, and so is a cron job re-running after a
 * deploy. Without the key, one completed booking pays out once per retry, and
 * the leaderboard ranks whoever's events got retried most.
 *
 * ─── Why createMany({skipDuplicates}) and not create() ───────────────
 *
 * A unique violation ABORTS the surrounding Postgres transaction. So the
 * tempting shape —
 *
 *     try { await tx.xpEvent.create(...) }
 *     catch (e) { if (isDuplicate(e)) return existing }   // ← cannot run
 *
 * — is broken: by the time we are in the catch, the transaction is dead and the
 * recovery read cannot execute. This is the third time this trap has come up in
 * this codebase (P09 bookings, P10 sessions, now here).
 *
 * `createMany({skipDuplicates: true})` does the conflict handling INSIDE the
 * statement (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and returns a count. Count 0 means "this
 * event was already recorded" — a normal, expected outcome, not an error.
