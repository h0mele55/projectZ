/**
 * Recording results and moving ratings.
 *
 * ─── Why this MUST be idempotent ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A rating update is NOT reversible by subtraction. Applying the same match
 * twice does not just double a delta — it feeds the second update a mu and
 * sigma that already contain the first, and the result is a rating that no
 * sequence of real matches could have produced. There is no clean way back:
 * you would have to replay the player's entire history from scratch.
 *
 * So `dedupeKey` is a UNIQUE column, and a re-reported result is a no-op rather
 * than a second rating. Same discipline as XP (P18) — and here the stakes are
 * higher, because XP can be clawed back and a corrupted rating cannot.
