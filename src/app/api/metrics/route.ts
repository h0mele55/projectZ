/**
 * The Prometheus scrape endpoint.
 *
 * ═══ THIS IS NOT PUBLIC ═══
 *
 * A metrics endpoint is an intelligence briefing on the business and on the
 * infrastructure. Left open it tells anybody who asks:
 *
 *   • exactly how many bookings we take, by sport, in real time — our revenue,
 *     our growth rate, and our seasonality, handed to a competitor for free;
 *   • our payment failure rate, which is a gift to anyone writing a story;
 *   • our route list, our queue names, our Node version, our memory ceiling and
 *     our event-loop lag — a map for anyone probing us.
 *
 * It is also a DoS surface: a scrape serialises every series in the registry, so
 * an unauthenticated endpoint that does real work is an unauthenticated endpoint
 * somebody will hammer.
 *
 * So it requires a bearer token. In a cluster you would ALSO bind it to the
 * internal network — belt and braces, because a token in a config map is a token
 * that leaks eventually.
 *
 * A ratchet (tests/guardrails/health-checks.test.ts) fails the build if this
 * route stops checking the token.

/**
 * Constant-time compare.

 * `a === b` on a secret leaks its length and its prefix through timing. That is
