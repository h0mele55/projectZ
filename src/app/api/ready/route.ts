/**
 * READINESS — "should traffic be sent to this pod?"
 *
 * ═══ THIS IS NOT LIVENESS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS AN OUTAGE ═══
 *
 * Liveness (`/api/health`) answers "is this process alive?" and deliberately
 * touches NOTHING. Readiness answers "can this pod serve a request right now?"
 * and therefore checks its dependencies.
 *
 * Confusing the two is the classic way to turn a recoverable incident into a
 * total outage:
 *
 *   • Put a database check in LIVENESS, and a thirty-second Postgres blip makes
 *     Kubernetes kill EVERY pod at once — including the ones that were fine. The
 *     database comes back; there is now nothing left to serve from. A degraded
 *     dependency has become a hard outage, and the restart storm makes the
 *     database's recovery slower.
 *
 *   • Leave the dependency check out of READINESS, and a pod that cannot reach
 *     Postgres keeps receiving traffic and 500ing at users, because as far as the
 *     load balancer knows it is perfectly healthy.
 *
 * So: liveness never touches the database. Readiness always does. A ratchet
 * (tests/guardrails/health-checks.test.ts) enforces both directions.
