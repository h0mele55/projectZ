 * the authentication, so it is verified against the RAW body before
 * anything else happens. `req.json()` would already have destroyed the
 * bytes the signature was computed over.
 *
 * Confirming a booking is idempotent: Stripe retries on any non-2xx, and it
 * will happily deliver the same event twice. `updateMany` on a PENDING row
 * means the second delivery is a no-op rather than a second confirmation
 * email and a second set of reminder jobs.
