/**
 * `cardVariants` — class-string variants for the Card primitive.
 *
 * Lives in its own file (not `card.tsx`) so SERVER components can
 * import + call it. `card.tsx` carries `"use client"` because it
 * exports the React component; in Next.js App Router, importing a
 * function from a `"use client"` module into a server component
 * makes the import a CLIENT REFERENCE that cannot be invoked at
 * SSR time. The runtime symptom is "An error occurred in the
 * Server Components render" on every server-rendered page that
 * touches `cardVariants(...)`.
 *
 * Splitting the cva function into a server-safe module fixes the
 * boundary: server components import from `card-variants.ts`
 * (no directive — usable everywhere), the `<Card>` JSX component
 * stays in `card.tsx`. Both files re-export `cardVariants` as
 * the same value.
 *
 * Roadmap-5 PR-1 originally co-located cardVariants in card.tsx;
 * this hotfix extracts it after a runtime breakage caused by the
 * server/client boundary.
