/**
 * AM I ALREADY INSIDE A BOTTOM SHEET?
 *
 * ═══ The bug this exists to make impossible ═══
 *
 * On mobile, `<Popover>` presents itself as a Vaul drawer — a bottom sheet. So
 * does `<Modal>`, and so does `<Sheet>`.
 *
 * Now open a searchable `<Combobox>` (which is a Popover) inside a `<Modal>`.
 * Two drawers mount, one on top of the other. What the user gets is:
 *
 *   • the second sheet animating up over the first, which looks broken;
 *   • two overlapping scroll locks, so the page underneath is stuck;
 *   • a drag-to-dismiss gesture that dismisses the WRONG sheet;
 *   • an escape key that closes both, or neither, depending on focus order.
 *
 * The existing fix is `forceDropdown` — a prop each call site passes to say "I
 * am inside a sheet, present as a popover instead". There are 11 of them in this
 * codebase, and agri-saas has 38.
 *
 * THAT IS THE WRONG SHAPE FOR A FIX. It is an opt-out that every future call
 * site must remember, in a situation the call site often cannot even see: whether
 * a Combobox is inside a Modal depends on where the component was *used*, not on
 * how it was *written*. A shared form component has no idea.
 *
 * So the component asks the tree instead. Any overlay that mounts as a drawer
 * declares it; a Popover nested inside one sees that and presents as a popover
 * automatically. `forceDropdown` remains as an explicit override, and the 11
 * existing sites simply become redundant.
 *
 * The failure mode flips from "you forgot a flag and it is broken" to "it is
 * right by default, and you can override it".
