/**
 * Stripe Connect.
 *
 * ─── Why DESTINATION charges, not separate charges + transfers ───────
 *
 * The money is charged on OUR platform account and settled to the venue's
 * connected account in a single atomic operation, with our commission taken
 * out via `application_fee_amount`.
 *
 * The alternative — charge the customer, then transfer to the venue in a
 * second call — has a window between the two. If the process dies in that
 * window, we are holding money that belongs to a club, with nothing in Stripe
 * saying so. Reconciling that by hand is somebody's very bad week.
 *
 * With a destination charge, there is no window. Stripe either did both or
 * neither.
 *
 * ─── Why `on_behalf_of` ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It makes the VENUE the merchant of record: their name on the customer's card
 * statement, their country's settlement rules, their Stripe fees. Without it
 * the customer sees *our* name for a court they booked at their local club,
 * which is both confusing and a dispute waiting to happen.
