/**
 * Postgres SQLSTATE extraction.
 *
 * P09's `createBooking` deliberately does NOT check "is this slot free?" —
 * under concurrency that check always loses. It attempts the INSERT and
 * maps `23P01` (exclusion_violation) to conflict('slot_taken'). That design
 * is only safe if we can reliably tell 23P01 from every other failure, so
 * this helper is load-bearing, not a convenience.
 *
 * Prisma 7 makes it harder than it should be: the top-level `code` is
 * Prisma's own `P2010`, and the real SQLSTATE sits at a depth that varies
 * with how the driver adapter classified the violation (a unique violation
 * gets a mapped `kind` + `originalCode`; an exclusion or CHECK violation
 * has no mapped kind and carries the raw pg error instead), and it is
 * re-wrapped again inside a `$transaction`.
 *
 * Hard-coding one path silently returns `undefined` the moment Prisma
 * shifts it — and `undefined !== '23P01'` would mean a double-booking
 * conflict surfacing as a 500 instead of a clean "someone just took this
 * slot". So we walk the graph.
