/**
 * How much of the screen the soft keyboard is currently covering.
 *
 * ═══ WHY `vh` DOES NOT WORK, AND WHY THIS HOOK EXISTS ═══
 *
 * Every overlay in this codebase caps its height in viewport units —
 * `max-h-[92vh]` on the sheet, `max-h-[min(85vh,680px)]` on the modal.
 *
 * `vh` is the LAYOUT viewport. It does not shrink when the soft keyboard opens.
 *
 * So a sheet sized to 92vh keeps its full height, the keyboard slides up over
 * the bottom half of it, and the input the user just tapped is now BEHIND the
 * keyboard. They are typing into something they cannot see. On a phone this is
 * not a cosmetic problem — it makes the form unusable, and the user has no idea
 * why, because the field looked fine right up until they touched it.
 *
 * `VisualViewport` is the API that knows the difference:
 *
 *   window.innerHeight        → the layout viewport (constant)
 *   visualViewport.height     → what the user can actually SEE (shrinks)
 *   visualViewport.offsetTop  → how far the page has been scrolled up to keep
 *                               the focused input in view
 *
 * The inset is what is left over: the keyboard, plus any browser chrome that
 * appeared with it.
 *
 * ─── This is not a rounding error ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A phone keyboard is ~40% of the screen. On a 851px-tall Pixel 5 that is
 * roughly 340px — nearly half the sheet.
