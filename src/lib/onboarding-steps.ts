/**
 * Centralised step definitions for the Driver.js-based product
 * tour.
 *
 * Each step pairs a STABLE anchor (sidebar `data-testid` slug or
 * a documented page-level `#id`) with a concise body. The tour
 * code (`<OnboardingTour>`) is a thin wrapper that hands these
 * to driver.js's API — adding/editing/removing a step is a
 * one-place change.
 *
 * Stability rules:
 *   - Only target IDs / data-testids that already exist in the
 *     codebase and have a documented purpose. The discovery
 *     pass for this file enumerated them; never invent new
 *     anchors here without adding them to the page first.
 *   - Every step MUST be safe to skip. If the target element is
 *     not on the current page (e.g. the user opens a tour from
 *     a route that doesn't contain the anchor), the runner
 *     filters the step out before driver.js sees it.
 *   - Order is intentional — the tour walks the sidebar
 *     top-to-bottom, then closes with two productivity-tip
 *     steps (palette + theme toggle).
 *
 * Tone: short, present-tense, action-oriented. The audience is
 * a tenant operator on their first login — they have ~15
 * seconds of patience, not 5 minutes.
 *
 * This system is INTENTIONALLY separate from the existing
 * `<OnboardingWizard>` (tenant initial-setup wizard at
 * `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx`), which is a
 * different concept (DB-backed multi-step config flow). The
 * structural ratchet at
 * `tests/unit/onboarding-tour-structural.test.ts` locks the
 * separation so future refactors can't conflate them.
