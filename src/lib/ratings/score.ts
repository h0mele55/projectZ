/**
 * How a venue gets its score.
 *
 * ─── Why not just average the stars? ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because a venue with ONE five-star review would outrank a venue with two
 * hundred reviews averaging 4.8. That is not a ranking; it is a reward for
 * having no track record. The first thing a new club would learn is to ask a
 * friend to leave one review and stop.
 *
 * Two different problems, two different tools:
 *
 *   BAYESIAN AVERAGE — for the score we DISPLAY. It pulls a venue with few
 *   reviews toward the global mean and lets it earn its way out. A single
 *   5-star review moves the needle a little; fifty move it a lot.
 *
 *   WILSON LOWER BOUND — for RANKING a list. It asks: given this sample, what
 *   is the LOWEST plausible true score? A venue we know little about ranks
 *   conservatively — not because it is bad, but because we cannot yet say it
 *   is good.
 *
 * Both are ~20 lines. Neither needs a dependency.
 */

/**
 * The prior: what we assume about a venue before it has any reviews.
 *
 * `PRIOR_WEIGHT` is "how many imaginary average reviews does a new venue start
 * with". At 10, a venue needs a real body of feedback before its own score
 * dominates — which is the entire point.
 *
 * Set it too low and one review swings the score. Too high and a genuinely
 * excellent new club looks mediocre for months. Ten is a starting position, not
 * a law of nature; it is one constant, in one place, tunable with data.

 *   fifty 5-star reviews  → (40 + 250)/ 60  = 4.83   (earned)
 *   one 1-star review     → (40 + 1)  / 11  = 3.73   (not 1.0)
 *
 * Note the last case: the prior protects venues from a single malicious
 * one-star as much as it protects users from a single friendly five-star. It
 * cuts both ways, which is what makes it fair rather than merely defensive.

 *
 *   • a venue with 200 reviews at 4.5 outranks one with 3 reviews at 5.0,
