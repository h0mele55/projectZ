 * The Meilisearch client.
 *
 * SERVER-SIDE ONLY. Meilisearch is never exposed to the browser, and the
 * master key never leaves the process.
 *
 * The "obvious" optimisation — let the client query Meilisearch directly with
 * a search-only key — leaks the whole index. Our indexes carry `tenantId`, so
 * a browser with a search key could enumerate every venue, coach and session
 * of every tenant, ignoring RLS entirely. The database's isolation would be
 * intact and the data would be public anyway.
 *
 * So search goes through /api/search, which applies tenant-safe filters.
