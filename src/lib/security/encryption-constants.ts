 * Tiny standalone module so the env-validation schema (`src/env.ts`),
 * the encryption runtime (`src/lib/security/encryption.ts`), and the
 * server-startup hook (`src/instrumentation.ts`) can reference the
 * same dev-fallback key without a circular import. Putting this

 *
 * NEVER acceptable in production. Three independent guards refuse
 * to start a production process whose live key equals this value:
 *
 *   1. Zod schema (`src/env.ts`) — validation error at module load.
 *   2. Startup hook (`src/instrumentation.ts`) — process.exit(1).
 *   3. Test guard (`tests/integration/startup-encryption-check.test.ts`)
 *      — CI fails if either of the above stops checking.
 *
 * The value is documented in source intentionally; its security
 * property is "well-known + refused in production", not "secret".
