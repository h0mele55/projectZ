/**
 * Tournament formats, behind OUR interface.
 *
 * ─── Why a wrapper, when the library already works ───────────────────
 *
 * `tournament-organizer` is MIT, competent, and maintained by ONE PERSON. That
 * is not a criticism — most good libraries are — but it is a fact worth
 * designing around when the thing it computes is the bracket of a tournament
 * people have paid to enter.
 *
 * If it is abandoned, breaks on a Node upgrade, or changes its pairing semantics
 * in a minor release, the blast radius should be THIS FILE, not every route,
 * component and test that ever touched a bracket.
 *
 * So the rest of the codebase talks to `TournamentFormat` — an interface we own,
 * in vocabulary we chose. The library sits behind it. Replacing it (or writing
 * Swiss pairing ourselves, which is a few hundred lines) becomes a contained
 * job rather than an archaeology project.
 *
 * A ratchet enforces this: nothing outside src/lib/tournaments/ may import
 * `tournament-organizer`.
