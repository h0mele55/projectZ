/**
 * PASSWORD FIELDS MUST BE AUTOFILLABLE.
 *
 * A password manager can only fill a field it can IDENTIFY, and `autoComplete`
 * is how it identifies one. Without it the browser offers nothing — or, worse,
 * offers the wrong thing, confidently filling a stale password into a "choose a
 * new one" box.
 *
 * ═══ THE REGRESSION CLASS IS SILENT ═══
 *
 * Nothing errors. Nothing looks broken. No test fails. The field simply never
 * autofills, and the user — who has a 40-character generated password in their
 * manager and no idea what it is — cannot log in to your app. They assume the
 * app is bad, and they are not wrong.
 *
 * It is invisible to everyone who builds the app, because everyone who builds
 * the app types their test password by hand.
 *
 * ═══ THIS GUARD MUST NOT PASS VACUOUSLY ═══
 *
 * playerz.bg has NO auth routes yet — no login, no register, no reset-password.
 *
 * A guard that scans for password fields, finds none, and reports success is
 * WORSE THAN NO GUARD. It is a green check that means nothing, and it will go on
 * meaning nothing on the day somebody adds a login form without autoComplete —
 * which is precisely the day it was supposed to fire.
 *
 * So it works the other way round. It asserts what MUST be true whenever a
 * password field exists, and it states plainly, in its own output, that it is
 * currently guarding an empty set. The moment the first password input lands, it
 * has something to check and it checks it.
