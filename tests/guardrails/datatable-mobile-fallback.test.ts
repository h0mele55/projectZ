/**
 * NO TABLE HORIZONTAL-SCROLLS ON A PHONE BY OMISSION.
 *
 * An eight-column table at 390px does not fit and will not wrap. Without a
 * fallback the overflow lands on the PAGE and the whole app scrolls sideways —
 * the #1 mobile bug class (see P1).
 *
 * ═══ THIS GUARD IS INVERTED FROM THE OBVIOUS ONE ═══
 *
 * The natural design — the one the prompt describes, and the right one for a
 * codebase whose tables scroll by default — is: "every <DataTable> must pass an
 * explicit mobileFallback".
 *
 * In THIS codebase that would be theatre. DataTable already collapses to cards
 * below `md`, automatically, for every table, with no opt-in. The default is
 * already the SAFE one. Forcing 11 call sites to write `mobileFallback="card"`
 * would add ceremony and protect nothing — and a ratchet that demands ceremony
 * without protection is a ratchet people learn to resent.
 *
 * So it guards the thing that can ACTUALLY go wrong here:
 *
 *   1. the safe default must STAY the default — nobody may flip it to 'scroll';
 *   2. any call site that DOES opt out must say why, in writing;
 *   3. the card renderer must remain reachable and usable.
 *
 * The failure mode being refused is identical. Only the direction is reversed.
