/**
 * EVERY WRITE INTO A MESSAGE BODY IS SANITISED.
 *
 * Chat is the highest-risk surface in the product: text one user writes and
 * another user's BROWSER renders.
 *
 * Sanitising at render time only means every future renderer has to remember —
 * and the one that forgets is a stored XSS that has been sitting in the
 * database since the day it was written. (P06 found exactly such a bug in the
 * ported sanitiser: a double-unescape that RESURRECTED the `<script>` tag it
 * had just stripped. `ChatMessage.body` is the field it would have resurrected
 * it into.)
 *
 * So the body is cleaned on the WAY IN, and this fails the build on a write
 * path that skips it.
