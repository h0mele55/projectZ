/**
 * POPOVER IS THE ONLY MENU PRIMITIVE.
 *
 * The hand-rolled floating menu is one of the most reliably broken patterns in
 * any React codebase. It looks like this:
 *
 *     const [openMenuId, setOpenMenuId] = useState<string | null>(null);
 *     ...
 *     {openMenuId === row.id && (
 *       <>
 *         <div className="fixed inset-0" onClick={() => setOpenMenuId(null)} />
 *         <div className="absolute top-full right-0 z-10">…</div>
 *       </>
 *     )}
 *
 * Every single one of these is wrong, in the same four ways:
 *
 *   1. IT CLIPS. The menu is `absolute`, so it is trapped inside the nearest
 *      ancestor with `overflow: hidden` or `overflow-x-auto` — which, on a table
 *      row, is the table. The last row's menu opens INTO the table and is cut
 *      off. It works perfectly in the developer's test with three rows.
 *
 *   2. IT HIDES UNDER FIXED CHROME. `z-10` loses to any bottom bar, sticky
 *      header or toast, which are all higher.
 *
 *   3. THE CLICK-AWAY EATS THE FIRST TAP ELSEWHERE. The `fixed inset-0` layer
 *      swallows the click that dismissed it, so the user has to tap twice to hit
 *      anything.
 *
 *   4. IT IS A NATIVE-FEELING MENU NOWHERE. No bottom sheet on mobile, no focus
 *      trap, no escape key, no arrow keys, no aria.
 *
 * `<Popover>` + `<Popover.Menu>` + `<Popover.Item>` solves all four: it PORTALS
 * on desktop (so nothing can clip it) and becomes a BOTTOM SHEET on mobile.
 *
 * ─── Empty allowlist, on purpose ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This codebase has zero hand-rolled menus today. So the ratchet starts at zero
 * and the first one ever written fails the build — rather than being grandfathered
 * in behind a baseline that somebody then adds to.
 */

/**
 * ONLY the three overlay primitives are exempt — not the whole component library.
 *
 * `popover.tsx`, `modal.tsx` and `sheet.tsx` are the things that legitimately
 * IMPLEMENT an overlay: they are where `fixed inset-0` is supposed to live. A
 * rule that banned it everywhere would ban the implementation of the rule.
 *
 * The obvious scoping — "exempt src/components/ui/**" — is what the prompt says,
 * and here it would be a mistake. 419 of this codebase's 431 components live in
 * `ui/`. Exempting the directory would leave the guard scanning SEVENTEEN files,
 * and a hand-rolled menu inside `ui/table/` is exactly as broken as one in a
 * page — arguably worse, because every page inherits it.
 *
 * So the exemption is three FILES, not a directory, and the guard scans 428.

 * it false-positived on the table's COLUMN-RESIZE HANDLE — `absolute right-0` is

 *
 * The second false positive was subtler: `before:absolute before:bottom-full` is
 * a 6px GRADIENT FADE above the sticky pagination bar. `before:` is a Tailwind
 * VARIANT PREFIX — it styles a pseudo-element, not the element. My pattern
 * ignored the prefix and read it as a menu.
 *
 * Hence the lookbehinds: the utility must not be prefixed by a variant.
