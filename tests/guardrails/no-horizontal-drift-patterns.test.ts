/**
 * HORIZONTAL DRIFT — THE #1 MOBILE BUG CLASS, CAUGHT AT AUTHORING TIME.
 *
 * "Drift" is when a page scrolls sideways on a phone. The user swipes down the
 * list, the whole page slides left, the layout tears, and nothing looks broken
 * to whoever built it on a 27-inch monitor.
 *
 * ─── Why a STATIC guard and not just an e2e check ────────────────────
 *
 * The e2e drift spec renders real pages at 390px and measures
 * `scrollWidth > clientWidth`. That is the ground truth, and it is the right
 * final check.
 *
 * But it can only test the pages that EXIST. Every page not yet written is one
 * PR away from reintroducing the bug, and the e2e suite will not know until
 * somebody adds it to the list. A sampled ratchet is not a guarantee.
 *
 * So this guard bans the ROOT-CAUSE PATTERNS in source, regardless of whether
 * any page renders them yet. It is the half of the promise that scales.
 *
 * ─── The two patterns ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   (a) An UNCOMPENSATED NEGATIVE MARGIN. `-mx-4` pulls content wider than its
 *       parent; if any ancestor scrolls, that extra width becomes horizontal
 *       scroll.
 *
 *       Note the rule is NOT "…inside a scroll container". I wrote it that way
 *       first, gating on whether the same FILE contained `overflow-y-auto`. It
 *       found nothing — because the scroll container is almost never in the same
 *       file as the margin. It lives in a parent component, or inside cmdk. The
 *       guard skipped every file and passed in silence, and its baseline was
 *       decorative.
 *
 *       You CANNOT know from a source file whether an element's parent scrolls.
 *       So the safe rule is the unconditional one: an uncompensated negative
 *       x-margin is a drift risk wherever it appears. Compensate it, or justify
 *       it here.
 *
 *   (b) A RAW <table> with no horizontal scroll context. A table is the one
 *       element that will not wrap: eight columns of content at 390px simply
 *       do not fit, and without an `overflow-x-auto` ancestor the whole PAGE
 *       carries the overflow instead of the table.
 *
 * Every rule is NEGATIVE-CONTROLLED at the bottom of the file: we prove the
 * pattern fires on the code it forbids, so nobody is protected by a regex that
 * silently stopped matching.

   * separator moved from 265 to 293 and the guard declared its own baseline
   * stale.
   *
   * A line-number baseline is invalidated by ANY edit above it, which means it
   * fails on PRs that have nothing to do with it. That is the fastest way to
   * teach people that this guard is noise.

   * The content is stable; the line number is not.
