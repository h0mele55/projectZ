/**
 * NO NATIVE <select> ON A PHONE.
 *
 * A native `<select>` is not a dropdown on mobile. It is an OS-rendered wheel or
 * full-screen list that we cannot style, cannot search, cannot make match the
 * app, and — the part that actually breaks things — cannot control the dismissal
 * of. It looks like a different application briefly took over.
 *
 * Worse, it is the ONE control that silently ignores the whole design system: no
 * tokens, no dark mode, no focus ring, no 44px target. It is a hole straight
 * through everything the component library guarantees.
 *
 * The replacement already exists: `<Combobox>` (searchable, `forceDropdown` when
 * inside a sheet), `<RadioGroup>`, `<ToggleGroup>`.
 *
 * ─── This ratchet has an EMPTY ALLOWLIST ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * That is deliberate, and it is the strongest form a ratchet can take.
 *
 * The usual shape is: remediate the violations, then baseline whatever survives.
 * A baseline is a debt, and it is the thing people add to when they are in a
 * hurry. Here there is nothing to remediate — the codebase already has zero
 * native selects — so the ratchet starts at zero and the FIRST one ever written
 * fails the build.
 *
 * If you are about to add an entry to an allowlist that does not exist, you are
 * about to be the first person to break this. Use a Combobox.
 *
 * ─── Scope ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ALL of src/**. Not just src/app/** — scoping a select-ratchet to routes is how
 * a native select ends up in a shared component and reaches every page at once.

/**
 * Strip comments AND strings.
 *
 * Both of the codebase's two `<select>` mentions live in PROSE — the primitives
 * describing themselves as its replacement:
 *
 *   combobox/index.tsx:  "…a drop-in replacement for native `<select>` inside…"
 *   status-badge.tsx:    "…can't be a <StatusBadge> element (e.g. interactive <select>…"
 *
 * A ratchet that flagged those would be a ratchet that punished the
 * documentation for describing the rule. It would be deleted within a week.
