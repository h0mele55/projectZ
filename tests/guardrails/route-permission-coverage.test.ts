/**
 * DEFAULT-DENY RATCHET.
 *
 * The way an unprotected admin endpoint ships is never a decision. It is an
 * omission: somebody adds `POST /api/t/[slug]/admin/refunds`, and simply
 * does not think about the permission table. Nothing fails. The route works
 * beautifully — for everyone.
 *
 * So the build asserts it: every MUTATING route handler under
 * `/api/t/[slug]/` must resolve to a permission. A new one with no rule
 * fails here, by name, with the fix spelled out.
 *
 * Reads are deliberately exempt — they are gated by RLS (which returns zero
 * rows for the wrong tenant) plus the route's own logic.
