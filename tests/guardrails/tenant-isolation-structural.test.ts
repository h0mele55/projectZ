/**
 * STRUCTURAL TENANT ISOLATION.
 *
 * RLS is the guarantee, and it fails CLOSED — a query that forgets its
 * tenant filter returns zero rows rather than another tenant's data. That
 * is the right failure mode, and it is exactly why this ratchet exists.
 *
 * Because "returns zero rows" is INVISIBLE. The endpoint 200s with an empty
 * list. No exception, no log line, no failing test — the page just says "no
 * bookings yet" to a customer who has twelve. And the moment somebody runs
 * that same repository from a job or an admin path that legitimately uses
 * `app_superuser` (which BYPASSES RLS), the missing filter stops being a
 * silent empty list and becomes a genuine cross-tenant leak.
 *
 * So: every Prisma call in a repository must carry an explicit `tenantId`,
 * even though RLS would add it anyway. Belt AND braces, enforced by the
 * build.
