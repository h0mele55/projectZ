/**
 * A DEPENDENCY NOBODY IMPORTS IS NOT FREE.
 *
 * It is:
 *
 *   • SUPPLY-CHAIN SURFACE. It runs its install scripts, it sits in the lockfile,
 *     and it is one compromised maintainer away from being a problem — for code
 *     that does nothing.
 *
 *   • NOISE. It shows up in `npm audit`, in licence scans, and in a permanent
 *     stream of Dependabot PRs about a package nobody uses. Ten such PRs teach
 *     people to ignore Dependabot, which is how the ONE that mattered gets missed.
 *
 * This ratchet exists because exactly that happened: `isomorphic-dompurify`,
 * `@stripe/stripe-js` and `@stripe/react-stripe-js` were all installed, all
 * unimported, and all generating major-version PRs.
 *
 * ─── What it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not try to be a general unused-dependency detector. Plenty of legitimate
 * dependencies are never `import`ed: a Jest reporter named in a CLI flag, a
 * PostCSS plugin named in a config, a type package consumed only by the compiler.
 * A naive scanner flags all of those, and a ratchet with false positives is a
 * ratchet people disable.
 *
 * So it checks a NAMED LIST of packages that must stay imported-or-gone, and
 * anything genuinely config-only is declared as such, in writing, here.
