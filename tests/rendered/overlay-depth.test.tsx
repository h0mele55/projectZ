/**
 * A POPOVER INSIDE A SHEET MUST NOT OPEN A SECOND SHEET.
 *
 * On mobile, Popover, Modal and Sheet all present as Vaul drawers. Open a
 * searchable Combobox (a Popover) inside a Modal and TWO drawers mount:
 *
 *   • the second animates up over the first, which looks broken;
 *   • two overlapping scroll locks, so the page underneath is stuck;
 *   • drag-to-dismiss dismisses the WRONG sheet;
 *   • escape closes both, or neither, depending on focus.
 *
 * `forceDropdown` was the opt-out — a flag every call site had to remember, in a
 * situation the call site often CANNOT SEE. Whether a Combobox is inside a Modal
 * depends on where the component was USED, not how it was written; a shared form
 * component has no idea.
 *
 * So the component asks the tree. These tests pin that.
